# Exercise 0: Hello World!

Let's get started! To minimize any tech-related "friction" during the training, we are gonna check our environment.

1. First, either connect to your remote PC (if this is an online training) or turn on your physical PC.
2. Now, I highly recommend to Download Visual Studio Code, as our PCs (by default) don't have any Editor besides NotePad++. https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3. Go to https://hub.docker.com and search for the official hello-world Image.
4. Open up the VS-Code Terminal or PowerShell and run the Container: *docker run <image_name>*
